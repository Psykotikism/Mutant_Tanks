## Notes
1. I do not provide support for listen/local servers but the plugin and its modules should still work properly on them.
2. I will not help you with installing or troubleshooting problems on your part.
3. If you get errors from SourceMod itself, that is your problem, not mine.
4. MAKE SURE YOU MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND FOLLOW THE INSTALLATION GUIDE PROPERLY.

## Installation
1. Delete files from old versions of the plugin.
2. Extract the folder inside the `mutant_tanks.zip` file.
3. Place all the contents into their respective folders.
4. If prompted to replace or merge anything, click yes.
5. Load up Mutant Tanks by restarting the server.
6. Customize Mutant Tanks in `addons/sourcemod/data/mutant_tanks/mutant_tanks.cfg`

## Uninstalling/Upgrading to Newer Versions
1. Delete `mutant_tanks` folder from:
 - `addons/sourcemod/plugins` folder (`mutant_tanks.smx` and all of its modules)
 - `addons/sourcemod/scripting` folder (`mutant_tanks.sp` and all of its modules)
2. Delete `mutant_tanks.txt` from `addons/sourcemod/gamedata` folder.
3. Delete `mutant_tanks.inc` and `mt_clone.inc` from `addons/sourcemod/scripting/include` folder.

## KeyValues Settings
> View the [INFORMATION.md](https://github.com/Psykotikism/Mutant_Tanks/blob/master/INFORMATION.md) file for information about each available setting. (Over 1,400 to customize!)

## Custom Configuration Files
> Mutant Tanks has features that allow for creating and executing custom configuration files.

By default, Mutant Tanks can create and execute the following types of configurations:
1. Difficulty - Files are created/executed based on the current game difficulty. (Example: If the current `z_difficulty` is set to Impossible (Expert mode), then `impossible.cfg` is executed (or created if it doesn't exist already).
2. Map - Files are created/executed based on the current map. (Example: If the current map is `c1m1_hotel`, then `c1m1_hotel.cfg` is executed (or created if it doesn't exist already).
3. Game mode - Files are created/executed based on the current game mode. (Example: If the current game mode is Versus, then `versus.cfg` is executed (or created if it doesn't exist already).
4. Daily - Files are created/executed based on the current day. (Example: If the current day is Friday, then `friday.cfg` is executed (or created if it doesn't exist already).
5. Player (survivor/infected/all) count - Files are created/executed based on the current number of human players. (Example: If the current number is 8, then `8.cfg` is executed (or created if it doesn't exist already).
6. Finale stages - Files are created/executed based on the finale stages called by the game. (Example: If the finale starts, then `finale_start.cfg` is executed (or created if it doesn't exist already)).

### Features
1. Create custom config files (can be based on difficulty, map, game mode, day, player (survivor/infected/all) count, or finale stage).
2. Execute custom config files (can be based on difficulty, map, game mode, day, player (survivor/infected/all) count, or finale stage).
3. Automatically generate config files for up to 66 players, all difficulties specified by `z_difficulty`, maps installed on the server, game modes specified by `sv_gametypes` and `mp_gamemode`, days of the `week`, and all possible `finale stages`.

> If you have any questions that aren't addressed below, feel free to message me or post on this [thread](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=302140). Read the INFORMATION.md file to learn about every setting/feature available. Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/Psykotikism/Mutant_Tanks/wiki) for more information, including examples and/or tutorials.

### Main Features
1. How do I make my own Mutant Tank?

- Create an entry.

Examples:

This is okay:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #25"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Test Tank" // Tank has a name.
			"Tank Enabled"				"1" // Tank is enabled.
			"Tank Chance"				"100.0" // Tank has 100% chance of spawning.
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1" // Tank can spawn.
			"Menu Enabled"				"1" // Tank can be spawned through the "sm_tank" command.
			"Skin Color"				"255,0,0,255" // Tank has red skin.
			"Glow Color"				"255,255,0" // Tank has a yellow glow outline.
		}
	}
}
```

This is not okay:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #25"
	{
		"General"
		{
			// "Tank Enabled" is missing so this entry is disabled.
			"Tank Name"				"Test Tank" // Tank has a name.
			"Tank Chance"				"47.0" // Tank has 47% chance of spawning.
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1" // Tank can spawn.
			"Menu Enabled"				"1" // Tank can be spawned through the "sm_tank" command.
			"Skin Color"				"255,0,0,255" // Tank has red skin.
			"Glow Color"				"255,255,0" // Tank has a yellow glow outline.
		}
	}
}
```

This is okay:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #25"
	{
		"General"
		{
			// Since "Tank Name" is missing, the default name for this entry will be "Tank"
			"Tank Enabled"				"1" // Tank is enabled.
			"Tank Chance"				"12.3" // Tank has 12.3% chance of spawning.
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1" // Tank can spawn.
			"Menu Enabled"				"1" // Tank can be spawned through the "sm_tank" command.
			"Skin Color"				"255,0,0,255" // Tank has red skin.
			"Glow Color"				"255,255,0" // Tank has a yellow glow outline.
		}
	}
}
```

This is not okay:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #25"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Test Tank" // Tank has a name.
			"Tank Enabled"				"1" // Tank is enabled.
			"Tank Chance"				"59.0" // Tank has 59% chance of spawning.
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1" // Tank can spawn.
			"Menu Enabled"				"1" // Tank can be spawned through the "sm_tank" command.
			"Skin Color"				"255 0 0 255" // The values should be separated by commas not white spaces.
			"Glow Color"				"255 255 0" // The values should be separated by commas not white spaces.
		}
	}
}
```

- Adding the entry to the roster.

Here's our final entry:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #25"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Test Tank" // Named "Test Tank".
			"Tank Enabled"				"1" // Entry is enabled.
			"Tank Chance"				"9.5" // Tank has 9.5% chance of spawning.
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1" // Tank can spawn.
			"Menu Enabled"				"1" // Tank can be spawned through the "sm_tank" command.
			"Skin Color"				"255,0,0,255" // Tank has red skin.
			"Glow Color"				"255,255,0" // Tank has a yellow glow outline.
		}
		"Immunities"
		{
			"Fire Immunity"				"1" // Immune to fire.
		}
	}
}
```

To make sure that this entry can be chosen, we must change the value in the `Type Range` setting.

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Plugin Settings"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Type Range"				"1-24" // Determines what entry to start and stop at when reading the entire config file.
		}
	}
}
```

Now, assuming that `Tank #25` is our highest entry, we just raise the maximum value of `Type Range` by 1, so we get 25 entries to choose from. Once the plugin starts reading the config file, when it gets to `Tank #25` it will stop reading the rest.

- Advanced Entry Examples

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Plugin Settings"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Type Range"				"1-5" // Check "Tank #1" to "Tank #5"
		}
	}
	"Tank #5" // Checked by the plugin.
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Leaper Tank"
			"Tank Enabled"				"1"
			"Tank Chance"				"75.2"
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1"
			"Menu Enabled"				"1"
			"Skin Color"				"255,255,0,255"
			"Glow Color"				"255,255,0"
		}
		"Enhancements"
		{
			"Extra Health"				"50" // Tank's base health + 50
		}
		"Jump Ability"
		{
			"Ability Enabled"			"2" // The Tank jumps periodically.
			"Ability Message"			"3" // Notify players when the Tank is jumping periodically.
			"Jump Height"				"300.0" // How high off the ground the Tank can jump.
			"Jump Interval"				"1.0" // How often the Tank jumps.
			"Jump Mode"				"0" // The Tank's jumping method.
		}
	}
}
```

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Plugin Settings"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Type Range"				"1-11" // Only check for the first 11 Tank types. ("Tank #1" to "Tank #11")
		}
	}
	"Tank #13" // This will not be checked by the plugin.
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Invisible Tank"
			"Tank Enabled"				"1"
			"Tank Chance"				"38.2"
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1"
			"Menu Enabled"				"1"
			"Skin Color"				"255,255,255,255"
			"Glow Color"				"255,255,255"

		}
		"Ghost Ability"

			"Ghost Fade Limit"			"0"
			"Ghost Fade Rate"			"0.1"
		}
	}
	"Tank #10" // Checked by the plugin.
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Enabled"				"1"
		}
		"Enhancements"
		{
			"Run Speed"				"1.5" // How fast the Tank moves.
		}
	}
}
```

2. Can you add more abilities or features?

- Mutant Tanks already uses a lot of files, so there's no room for anymore abilities or features as of `v8.80`.

3. How do I enable/disable the plugin in certain game modes?

You have 2 options:

- Enable/disable in certain game mode types. (You must add numbers up together in `Game Mode Types`.)
- Enable/disable in specific game modes. (You must specify the game modes in `Enabled Game Modes` and `Disabled Game Modes`.)

Here are some scenarios and their outcomes:

Scenario 1:

```
"Game Mode Types" "0" // The plugin is enabled in all game mode types.
"Enabled Game Modes" "" // The plugin is enabled in all game modes.
"Disabled Game Modes" "coop" // The plugin is disabled in "coop" mode.

Outcome: The plugin works in every game mode except "coop" mode.
```

Scenario 2:

```
"Game Mode Types" "1" // The plugin is enabled in every Campaign-based game mode.
"Enabled Game Modes" "coop" // The plugin is enabled in only "coop" mode.
"Disabled Game Modes" "" // The plugin is not disabled in any game modes.

Outcome: The plugin works only in "coop" mode.
```

Scenario 3:

```
"Game Mode Types" "5" // The plugin is enabled in every Campaign-based and Survival-based game mode.
"Enabled Game Modes" "coop,versus" // The plugin is enabled in only "coop" and "versus" mode.
"Disabled Game Modes" "coop" // The plugin is disabled in "coop" mode.

Outcome: The plugin works only in "coop" mode.
```

4. How come some Mutant Tanks aren't showing up?

It may be due to one or more of the following:

- The `Tank Enabled` setting for that Mutant Tank may be set to 0 or doesn't exists at all which defaults to 0.
- The `Spawn Enabled` setting for that Mutant Tank may be set to 0.
- You have created a new Mutant Tank and didn't raise the maximum value of `Type Range`.
- You have misspelled one of the settings.
- You are still using the `Tank Character` setting which is no longer used since `v8.16`.
- You didn't set up the Mutant Tank properly.
- You are missing quotation marks.
- You are missing curly braces.
- You have more than 500 Mutant Tanks in your config file.
- You didn't format your config file properly.
- The Mutant Tanks requires X human-controlled survivors around and there are none.
- The Mutant Tank needs to be in an open area to spawn and it's currently in a narrow place.
- The number of Mutant Tanks currently alive with the same type has reached or exceeded the limit set by the `Type Limit`.
- The Mutant Tank can only spawn on regular maps.
- The Mutant Tank can only spawn on finale maps.

5. How do I kill the Tanks depending on what abilities they have?

The following abilities require different strategies:

- Absorb Ability: The Mutant Tank takes way less damage. Conserve your ammo and maintain distance between you and the Mutant Tank.
- God Ability: The Mutant Tank will have god mode temporarily and will not take any damage at all until the effect ends. Maintain distance between you and the Mutant Tank.
- Bullet Immunity: Forget your guns. Just spam your grenade launcher at it, slash it with an axe or crowbar, or burn it to death.
- Explosive Immunity: Forget explosives and just focus on gunfire, melee weapons, and molotovs/gascans.
- Fire Immunity: No more barbecued Tanks. Just keep shooting
- Melee Immunity: No more Gordon Freeman players (immune to melee weapons including crowbar).
- Nullify Hit: The Mutant Tank can mark players as useless, which means as long as that player is nullified, they will not do any damage.
- Shield Ability: If set to be weak to explosives, wait for the Tank to throw propane tanks at you and then throw it back at the Tank. Then shoot the propane tank to deactivate the Tank's shield. If set to be weak to fire, wait for the Tank to throw gascans at you and then throw it back at the Tank. Then shoot the gascan to deactivate the Tank's shield. If set to be weak to bullets, just keep shooting the Tank. If set to be weak to melee hits, just keep slashing at the Tank.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/Psykotikism/Mutant_Tanks/wiki) for more information on each ability's strengths and weaknesses.

6. How can I change the amount of Tanks that spawn on each finale wave?

Here's an example:

```
"Finale Waves" "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10" // Spawn 2 Tanks on the 1st wave, 3 Tanks on the 2nd wave, 4 Tanks on the 3rd wave, etc.
```

7. How can I change the amount of Tanks that can spawn on finale maps?

Set the value in `Finale Amount`.

8. How can I decide whether to display each Tank's health?

Set the value in `Display Health`.

9. Why do some Tanks spawn with different props?

Each prop has X out of 100.0% chance to appear on Mutant Tanks when they spawn. Configure the chances for each prop in the `Props Chance` setting.

10. Why are the Tanks spawning with more than the extra health given to them?

Since `v8.10`, extra health given to Tanks is now multiplied by the number of alive non-idle human survivors present when the Tank spawns.

11. How do I add more Mutant Tanks?

- Add a new entry in the config file.
- Raise the maximum value of the `Type Range` setting.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Plugin Settings"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Type Range"				"1-69" // The plugin will check for 69 entries when loading the config file.
		}
	}
	"Tank #69"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Enabled"				"1" // Tank #69 is enabled and can be chosen.
		}
	}
}
```

12. How do I filter out certain Mutant Tanks that I made without deleting them?

Enable/disable them with the `Tank Enabled` setting.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #1"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Enabled"				"1" // Tank #1 can be chosen.
			"Tank Chance"				"100.0" // Tank #1 has a chance to spawn.
		}
	}
	"Tank #2"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Enabled"				"0" // Tank #2 cannot be chosen.
			"Tank Chance"				"0.0" // Tank #2 has no chance to spawn but can still be spawned through the menu.
		}
	}
	"Tank #3"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Enabled"				"0" // Tank #3 cannot be chosen.
			"Tank Chance"				"0.0" // Tank #3 has no chance to spawn but can still be spawned through the menu.
		}
	}
	"Tank #4"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Enabled"				"1" // Tank #4 can be chosen.
			"Tank Chance"				"100.0" // Tank #4 has a chance to spawn.
		}
	}
}
```

13. Can I create temporary Tanks without removing or replacing them?

Yes, you can do that with custom configs.

Example:

```
// Settings for addons/sourcemod/data/mutant_tanks/mutant_tanks.cfg
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Plugin Settings"
	{
		"Custom"
		{
			"Enable Custom Configs"			"1" // Enable custom configs
			"Execute Config Types"			"1" // 1: Difficulty configs (easy, normal, hard, impossible)
		}
	}
	"Tank #69"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Psyk0tik Tank"
			"Tank Enabled"				"1"
			"Tank Chance"				"2.53"
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1"
			"Menu Enabled"				"1"
			"Skin Color"				"0,170,255,255"
			"Glow Color"				"0,170,255"
		}
		"Enhancements"
		{
			"Extra Health"				"250"
		}
		"Immunities"
		{
			"Fire Immunity"				"1"
		}
	}
}

// Settings for addons/sourcemod/data/mutant_tanks/difficulty_configs/impossible.cfg
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #69"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Idiot Tank"
			"Tank Enabled"				"1"
			"Tank Chance"				"1.0"
			"Spawn Enabled"				"1"
			"Menu Enabled"				"1"
			"Skin Color"				"1,1,1,255"
			"Glow Color"				"1,1,1"
		}
		"Enhancements"
		{
			"Extra Health"				"1"
		}
		"Immunities"
		{
			"Fire Immunity"				"0"
		}
	}
}

Output: When the current difficulty is Expert mode (impossible), the Idiot Tank will spawn instead of Psyk0tik Tank as long as custom configs is being used.

These are basically temporary Tanks that you can create for certain situations, like if there's 5 players on the server, the map is c1m1_hotel, or even if the day is Thursday, etc.
```

14. How can I move the Mutant Tanks category around on the admin menu?

- You have to open up `addons/sourcemod/configs/adminmenu_sorting.txt` and add the `MutantTanks` category.
- This also allows you to sort each item in the category.

Example:

```
"Menu"
{
	"PlayerCommands"
	{
		"item"		"sm_slay"
		"item"		"sm_slap"
		"item"		"sm_kick"
		"item"		"sm_ban"
		"item"		"sm_gag"
		"item"		"sm_burn"
		"item"		"sm_beacon"
		"item"		"sm_freeze"
		"item"		"sm_timebomb"
		"item"		"sm_firebomb"
		"item"		"sm_freezebomb"
	}

	"ServerCommands"
	{
		"item"		"sm_map"
		"item"		"sm_execcfg"
		"item"		"sm_reloadadmins"
	}

	"VotingCommands"
	{
		"item"		"sm_cancelvote"
		"item"		"sm_votemap"
		"item"		"sm_votekick"
		"item"		"sm_voteban"
	}

	"MutantTanks"
	{
		"item"		"sm_mt_tank"
		"item"		"sm_mt_config"
		"item"		"sm_mt_info"
		"item"		"sm_mt_list"
		"item"		"sm_mt_reload"
		"item"		"sm_mt_version"
	}
}
```

15. How can I disable the `MutantTanks` category for some admins?

You can use the `mt_adminmenu` override to restrict the category to certain admin flags/groups.

16. Are there any developer/tester features available in the plugin?

Yes, there are forwards, natives, stocks, target filters for each special infected, and an admin command that allows developers/testers to spawn and test each Mutant Tank.

Forwards:

```
/**
 * Called every second to trigger a Mutant Tank's ability.
 * Use this forward for any passive abilities.
 *
 * @param tank			Client index of the Tank.
 **/
forward void MT_OnAbilityActivated(int tank);

Commands:

```
// Requires "z" (Root) flag.
sm_tank - Spawn a Mutant Tank.
sm_mt_tank - Spawn a Mutant Tank.

Valid inputs:

1. sm_tank <type 1*-500*> <amount: 1-32> <0: spawn on crosshair|1: spawn automatically> *The minimum and maximum values are determined by "Type Range". (The lowest value you can set is 1 and the highest value you can set is "500" though.)
2. sm_tank <type name*> <amount: 1-32> <0: spawn on crosshair|1: spawn automatically> *The plugin will attempt to match the name with any of the Mutant Tank types' names. (Partial names are acceptable. If more than 1 match is found, a random match is chosen. If 0 matches are found, the command cancels the request.)

The command has 4 functions.

If you are not a Tank:

1. When facing a non-Tank entity, a Mutant Tank will spawn with the chosen type.
2. When facing a Tank, it will switch to the chosen type.

If you are a Tank:

1. When holding down the +speed (default: LSHIFT) button, a Mutant Tank will spawn into the chosen type.
2. When not holding down the +speed button, you will transform into the chosen type.

### Configuration Formatting
1. How many config formats are there?

At the moment, there are 4 different formats.

2. Do I need to edit my current config file from version 8.57 and below?

No, all plugins still read the original format properly.

3. Which config format should I use?

Whichever one you want. You are free to combine all of them as well, it doesn't matter. For consistency and to avoid confusion, this file and any other file with config examples will use the original format.

Example:

```
// Original format

}
```

4. Is it possible to configure more than one type in one section?

Yes, you can either apply global settings for all types to use or specify certain types to use them.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	// Applies to every type.
	"All"
	{
		"Health"
		{
			"Extra Health"				"1000"
		}
	}
	// Applies to types 1 and 10.
	"1,10"
	{
		"Health"
		{
			"Extra Health"				"1000"
		}
	}
	// Applies to types 11 through 20.
	"11-20"
	{
		"Health"
		{
			"Extra Health"				"1000"
		}
	}
	// Applies to types 21 through 30 and types 31 through 40.
	"21-30,31-40"
	{
		"Health"
		{
			"Extra Health"				"1000"
		}
	}
}
```

5. Is it possible to configure more than one ability in one section?

Yes, you can either apply global settings for all abilities to use or specify certain abilities to use them.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #1"
	{
		// Applies to every ability.
		"All"
		{
			"Ability Enabled"			"1"
		}
		// Applies to Absorb and Acid abilities.
		"Absorb,Acid"
		{
			"Ability Enabled"			"1"
		}
	}
}
```

### Administration System
1. How does the system work?

The administration system is designed for the usage and effectiveness of each Mutant Tank type. Basically, it controls and determines what kind of Mutant Tanks players can use or be immune from.

2. Why create an entirely new administration system instead of using SourceMod's own system?

At first, using SM's own system was the goal, but that system has certain limitations that I wanted to get rid of for this project. For example, in SM's system, assigning multiple flags to an override command requires admins to have all of those flags. In this system, admins only need one of those flags, which makes the system flexible for filtering multiple admin flags.

Example:

```
// SM's system
"sm_tank"			"abc" // Admins need all three flags to use the command.

// MT's system
"Access Flags"			"abc" // Admins only need one of these flags to access a Mutant Tank type.
```

3. What are the admin flags used for?

The flags are used for two things:
- Accessibility - What Mutant Tank types admins can access.
- Immunity - What Mutant Tank types admins are immune to.

4. What other features does the system have?

Currently, the system allows admins to each have a favorite/custom/personalized Mutant Tank type.

Each custom admin setting will override its corresponding Mutant Tank type-specific setting or general setting. This is a powerful feature because each admin can have his/her own custom-made Mutant Tank type without tampering with the Mutant Tank type settings or general settings.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"STEAM_0:1:23456789"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Awesome Player" // Admin-controlled Tanks will have this name.
		}
	}
	"Tank #1"
	{
		"General"
		{
			"Tank Name"				"Awesome AI" // AI Tanks will have this name.
		}
	}
}
```

5. How does the override feature work?

It will sound complicated but here is the simplest way to explain it:

Ability Overrides

```
If a player's ability flags have one of the access flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have access to the ability.
If a player's ability flags have one of the immunity flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the ability.

OR

If a player's type flags have one of the access flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have access to the ability.
If a player's type flags have one of the immunity flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the ability.

OR

If a player's general MT flags have one of the access flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have access to the ability.
If a player's general MT flags have one of the immunity flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the ability.

OR

If a player's SM flags have one of the access flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have access to the ability.
If a player's SM flags have one of the immunity flags required for an ability or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the ability.

Note: If all 4 of these return false, the player will not have access to nor immunity from that ability.
```

Type Overrides

```
If a player's ability flags have one of the access flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have access to the ability of the type.
If a player's ability flags have one of the immunity flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the ability of the type.

OR

If a player's type flags have one of the access flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have access to the type.
If a player's type flags have one of the immunity flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the type.

OR

If a player's general MT flags have one of the access flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have access to the type.
If a player's general MT flags have one of the immunity flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the type.

OR

If a player's SM flags have one of the access flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have access to the type.
If a player's SM flags have one of the immunity flags required for a type or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from the type.

Note: If all 4 of these return false, the player will not have access to nor immunity from that type.
```

Global Overrides

```
If a player's ability flags have one of the access flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have access to all abilities that require those flags.
If a player's ability flags have one of the immunity flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from all abilities that require those flags.

OR

If a player's type flags have one of the access flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have access to all types that require those flags.
If a player's type flags have one of the immunity flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from all types that require those flags.

OR

If a player's general MT flags have one of the access flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have access to all types and abilities that require those flags.
If a player's general MT flags have one of the immunity flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from all types and abilities that require those flags.

OR

If a player's SM flags have one of the access flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have access to all types and abilities that require those flags.
If a player's SM flags have one of the immunity flags required globally or vice-versa, the player will have immunity from all types and abilities that require those flags.

Note: If all 4 of these return false, the player will not have access to nor immunity from anything.
```

6. What is the `Allow Developer` setting for?

The setting allows the developer (Psyk0tik/Crasher_3637) to access certain features of the project on your server. These features include:
- Access to all Mutant Tanks. (Allows the developer to see what Mutant Tanks your config has.)
- Immunity from all Mutant Tanks. (Allows the developer to test each Mutant Tank without having to deal with each ability's effects.)
- Ability to spawn Mutant Tanks. (Allows the developer to spawn each Mutant Tank for testing.)
- Check which abilities are installed. (Allows the developer to check which abilities to test for.)

In short, this setting does not give the developer access to other features or plugins, thus avoiding the potential to cause trouble on your server. Disable the setting if you are not confident with trusting the developer. This setting was added to help server owners give the developer temporary access in case the developer needs to help server owners debug problems.

### Human Support
1. How do I enable human support?

Set `Human Support` to 1 or 2.

2. Can players use the abilities automatically/manually?

Yes, just set `Human Ability` to 1 or 2 for EACH ability.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #1"
	{
		"Fast Ability"
		{
			"Human Ability"				"1"
		}
	}
}
```

3. How can players use the abilities manually?

There are 4 buttons that players can use when they spawn as Mutant Tanks.

```
+use (default: E) - Main ability
+reload (default: R) - Sub/range ability
+zoom (default: Mouse3/Scroll wheel) - Special ability
+duck (default: CTRL) - Upon-death ability
```

Whatever each button activates is entirely up to your configuration settings.

4. How do I change the buttons or add extra buttons?

Edit lines 90-93 of the `mutant_tanks.inc` file and recompile each ability plugin.

5. What happens if a Mutant Tank has multiple abilities that are all activated by the same button?

All related abilities may or may not activate at the same time, depending on your configuration settings. It is recommended to not stack many abilities for human-controlled Mutant Tanks.

6. How do I limit the usage of abilities for each player?

Set the `Human Ammo` setting for each ability to whatever value you want.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #1"
	{
		"Fast Ability"
		{
			"Human Ammo"				"1"
		}
	}
}
```

7. Can I add a cooldown to the usage of abilities for each player?

Yes, just set the `Human Cooldown` setting for each ability to whatever value you want.

Example:

```
"Mutant Tanks"
{
	"Tank #1"
	{
		"Fast Ability"
		{
			"Human Cooldown"			"30"
		}
	}
}
```

8. What is the `Human Duration` setting for in some of the abilities?

That setting is a special duration for players, but they only apply if the `Human Mode` setting is set to 0.

Furthermore, there are some duration settings for abilities that will also affect players. Read the `INFORMATION.md` file for more details.

9. What is the `Human Mode` setting for in some of the abilities?

That setting is a special mode setting for players, which can determine how some abilities are activated. Read the `INFORMATION.md` file for more details.

10. Is there any way players can view information about this feature in-game?

Yes, each ability has a `sm_mt_<ability name here>` command that players can use anytime to view information about abilities.

The commands will each provide a menu that players can use to display certain information in chat.

The information displayed in chat will be more detailed and accurate when the player is playing as a Mutant Tank.

11. Is there any way players can change their current Mutant Tank type in the middle of a fight?

Yes, players can use the `sm_mutanttank` command if the `Spawn Mode` setting under the `Human Support` section under the `Plugin Settings` section is set to 0. There will be a cooldown though to prevent abuse.

12. Is there any way to exempt admins from the cooldown mentioned in question #11?

Yes, assign admins the `mt_adminversus` override.

Example:

```
Overrides
{
	"mt_adminversus"		"z" // All admins with the "z" (Root) flag are exempted from cooldowns.
}
```

### Configuration
1. How do I enable the custom configurations features?

Set `Enable Custom Configs` to 1.

2. How do I tell the plugin to only create certain custom config files?

Set the values in `Create Config Types`.

Examples:

```
"Create Config Types" "7" // Creates the folders and config files for each difficulty, map, and game mode.
"Create Config Types" "8" // Creates the folder and config files for each day.
"Create Config Types" "31" // Creates the folders and config files for each difficulty, map, game mode, day, and player count.
"Create Config Types" "255" // Creates the folders and config files for each difficulty, map, game mode, day, player (survivor/infected/all) count, and finale stage.
```

3. How do I tell the plugin to only execute certain custom config files?

Set the values in `Execute Config Types`.

Examples:

```
"Execute Config Types" "7" // Executes the config file for the current difficulty, map, and game mode.
"Execute Config Types" "8" // Executes the config file for the current day.
"Execute Config Types" "31" // Executes the config file for the current difficulty, map, game mode, day, and player count.
"Execute Config Types" "255" // Executes the config file for the current difficulty, map, game mode, day, player (survivor/infected/all) count, and finale stage.
```
