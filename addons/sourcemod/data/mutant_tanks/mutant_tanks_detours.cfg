/**
 * Mutant Tanks Detours
 * --
 * Notices
 * - For users: Do NOT change anything here unless you know what you are doing.
 * - For developers: These are all the necessary information for each detour done by Mutant Tanks.
 * --
 * Notes
 * - A lot of these detours just block functions or create forwards for functions that other plugins can use.
 * - Most of these detours are used for the Reward system.
 * - Most of the keys must have values since this config file is strictly read due to how powerful detouring is.
